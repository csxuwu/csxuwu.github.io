I am working towards a Ph.D. degree in Computer Vision Insitute, SZU, under the supervision of Prof.[Zhihui Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CkK6ULsAAAAJ). I have published several papers in journals/conferences, including Chinese Journal of Computers, Chinese Journal of Electronics, IEEE Transactions
on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, etc.. I serve as a reviewer of journals, e.g., IEEE Transactions
on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, and IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica. 
My research interests include contrastive learning, image processing, low-light image enhancment, low-light image semantic segmantation. My curriculum vitae can be found at [here](./CV_wuxu.pdf).

[A Multi-Reconstruciton Variational AutoEncoder for Low-light Image Enhancement](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=3uoqIhG8C44YLTlOAiTRKibYlV5Vjs7i8oRR1PAr7RxjuAJk4dHXos_BuYfGFXVpmBdnj0gpB6SeN-FNUbuzCTM22HnKm5Mc&uniplatform=NZKPT)

- Aiming at the low brightness, multi-noise, and blur of low illumination images, we propose Multiple Reconstruction-Variational AutoEncoder (MR-VAE) to gradually denoise and produce high-quality low illumination enhanced images from coarse to fine. MR-VAE consists of three modules: feature probability distribution capture, global reconstruction, and detail reconstruction. The core idea is to reconstruct the global features and local features in stages, and the global reconstruction module constructs the global features of the image and initially enhances the low illumination, to get a coarser image; the detail reconstruction module produces images with more realistic details, less noise, and more appropriate brightness based on the coarse image; In addition, this paper defines a multiple loss function replacement loss to guide the network to generate high-quality images.

[Decoupled Mixup for Out-of-Distribution Visual Recognition.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14783.pdf)

**Liu, H.**, Zhang, W., Xie J., Wu, H., Li, B., Zhang, Z., Li, Y., Huang, Y., Ghanem, B., Y. Zheng.
  
- We propose a novel ‚ÄùDecoupled-Mixup‚Äù method to train CNN models for OOD visual recognition. Different from previous work combining pairs of images homogeneously, our method decouples each image into discriminative and noise-prone regions, and then heterogeneously combine these regions of image pairs to train CNN models.

[Effective Presentation Attack Detection Driven by Face Related Task](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20065-6_24)

- Unlike this specific PAD task, other face related tasks trained by huge amount of real faces (e.g. face recognition and attribute editing) can be effectively adopted into different application scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose to trade position of PAD and face related work in a face system and apply the free acquired prior knowledge from face related tasks to solve face PAD, so as to improve the generalization ability in detecting PAs.

[Point Beyond Class: A Benchmark for Weakly Semi-Supervised Abnormality Localization in Chest X-Rays](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16437-8_24)

Ji, H.\*, **Liu, H.**\*, Li, Y.\*, Xie J., He, N., Huang, Y., Dong, W., Chen, X., Shen L. & Zheng, Y. (**\* Equal Contribution**)
 
- We propose to train the CXR abnormality localization framework via a weakly semi-supervised strategy, termed Point Beyond Class (PBC), which utilizes a small number of fully annotated CXRs with lesion-level bounding boxes and extensive weakly annotated samples by points. Such a point annotation setting can provide weakly instance-level information for abnormality localization with a marginal annotation cost.

[Group-wise Inhibition based Feature Regularization for Robust Classification](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Liu_Group-Wise_Inhibition_Based_Feature_Regularization_for_Robust_Classification_ICCV_2021_paper.html)

**Liu, H.**, Wu, H., Xie, W., Liu, F., & Shen, L.

- CNN pays more attention to the most discriminative regions, but ignores the auxiliary features when learning, leading to the lack of feature diversity for final judgment. In our method, we propose to dynamically suppress significant activation values of CNN by group-wise inhibition, but not fixedly or randomly handle them when training. The feature maps with different activation distribution are then processed separately to take the feature independence into account. CNN is finally guided to learn richer discriminative features hierarchically for robust classification according to the proposed regularization. [**Code**](https://github.com/LinusWu/TENET_Training)
