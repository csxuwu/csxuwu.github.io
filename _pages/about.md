<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

I am working towards a Ph.D. degree in Computer Vision Insitute, SZU, under the supervision of Prof. [Zhihui Lai](https://scholar.google.com/citations?hl=zh-CN&user=CkK6ULsAAAAJ). I have published several papers in journals/conferences, including the Chinese Journal of Computers, the Chinese Journal of Electronics, IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, etc. I serve as a reviewer of journals, e.g., IEEE Transactions
on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence, International Journal of Machine Learning and Cybernetics, and IEEE/CAA Journal of Automatica Sinica. 
My research interests include contrastive learning, image processing (low-light image enhancement, medical image enhancement), and low-light image semantic segmentation.

[CodeEnhance: A Codebook-Driven Approach for Low-Light Image Enhancement](http://arxiv.org/abs/2404.05253)

Xu Wu, XianXu Hou, Zhihui Lai$^{*}$, Jie Zhou, Ya-nan Zhang, Witold Pedrycz, Linlin Shen
  
- Low-light image enhancement (LLIE) aims to improve low-illumination images. However, existing methods face two challenges: (1) uncertainty in restoration from diverse brightness degradations; (2) loss of texture and color information caused by noise suppression and light enhancement. In this paper, we propose a novel enhancement approach, CodeEnhance, by leveraging quantized priors and image refinement to address these challenges.

Coarse-to-Fine Low-light Image Enhancement with Light Restoration and Color Refinement

**Xu Wu**, Zhihui Lai, Shiqi Yu, Jie Zhou, Zhuoqian Liang, Linlin Shen 
  
- Low-light image enhancement aims to improve the illumination intensity while restoring color information. Although recent deep learning-based methods have achieved impressive results, they still suffer from over or under-light enhancement in complex illumination scenes and poor contrast and saturation recovery in dark regions. To address these drawbacks, we propose a novel pipeline (called LRCR-Net) to perform Light Restoration and Color Refinement in a coarse-to-fine manner.

Light-Aware Contrastive Learning for Low-light Image Enhancement

**Xu Wu**, Zhihui Lai, Xianxu Hou, Jiajun Wen, Linlin Shen 
  
- Low-light image Enhancement (LLIE) presents challenges due to texture information loss and uneven illumination, which can distort feature distribution and reduce the quality of the enhanced images. However, current deep learning methods for LLIE only use supervised information from clear images to extract low-light image features, while disregarding the negative information in low-light images (i.e., low illumination and noise). To address these challenges, we propose a novel LLIE method, LACR-VAE, by leveraging the negative information and considering the uneven illumination..

[A Multi-Reconstruction Variational AutoEncoder for Low-light Image Enhancement](https://kns.cnki.net/kcms2/article/abstract?v=3uoqIhG8C44YLTlOAiTRKibYlV5Vjs7i8oRR1PAr7RxjuAJk4dHXos_BuYfGFXVpmBdnj0gpB6SeN-FNUbuzCTM22HnKm5Mc&uniplatform=NZKPT)

Zetao Jiang, **Xu Wu**, Shaoqin Zhang
  
- Aiming at the low brightness, multi-noise, and blur of low illumination images, we propose Multiple Reconstruction-Variational AutoEncoder (MR-VAE) to gradually denoise and produce high-quality low illumination enhanced images from coarse to fine. MR-VAE consists of three modules: feature probability distribution capture, global reconstruction, and detail reconstruction. The core idea is to reconstruct the global features and local features in stages, and the global reconstruction module constructs the global features of the image and initially enhances the low illumination, to get a coarser image; the detail reconstruction module produces images with more realistic details, less noise, and more appropriate brightness based on the coarse image; In addition, this paper defines a multiple loss function replacement loss to guide the network to generate high-quality images.

A Variational Autoencoder with Attention and Context Encoding for Low-light Image Enhancement

Zetao Jiang, **Xu Wu**, Rushi Lan, Zhuoqian Liang, Zhihui Lai
  
- The low-illumination image enhancement is a challenging task because color restoration, denoising, and light enhancement should all be taken into account. However, most previous works focus on light enhancement, which makes it difficult to generate high-quality enhanced images. To address this dilemma, a novel deep probabilistic framework that integrates both attention mechanism and context encoding into a unique variational autoencoder (ACE-VAE) is proposed.
