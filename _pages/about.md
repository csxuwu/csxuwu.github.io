I am working towards a Ph.D. degree in AI Initiative, KAUST, under the supervision of Prof.[Juergen Schmidhuber](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=gLnCTgIAAAAJ&hl=en). I have published several papers in top-tier journals/conferences, including CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, AAAI, MICCAI, IEEE Trans on Image Processing, etc.. I serve as a reviewer of top-tier conferences, e.g., CVPR'2023,  CVPR'2022, ICML'2022, ECCV'2022, and MICCAI'2022. 
Previously, I interned at Jarvis Lab, Tencent, and was a visiting student at NBL, NTNU. My research interests include regularization, self-supervised learning, adversarial learning, and reinforcement learning. My curriculum vitae can be found at [here](./haozheliu.pdf).

[Combating Mode Collapse in GANs via Manifold Entropy Estimation](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2208.12055.pdf)

**Liu, H.**, Li, B., Wu, H., Liang, H., Huang, Y., Li, Y., ... & Zheng, Y.
  
- In this paper, we propose a novel training pipeline to address the mode collapse issue of GANs. Different from existing methods, we propose to generalize the discriminator as feature embedding and maximize the entropy of distributions in the embedding space learned by the discriminator.

[Decoupled Mixup for Out-of-Distribution Visual Recognition.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.14783.pdf)

**Liu, H.**, Zhang, W., Xie J., Wu, H., Li, B., Zhang, Z., Li, Y., Huang, Y., Ghanem, B., Y. Zheng.
  
- We propose a novel ‚ÄùDecoupled-Mixup‚Äù method to train CNN models for OOD visual recognition. Different from previous work combining pairs of images homogeneously, our method decouples each image into discriminative and noise-prone regions, and then heterogeneously combine these regions of image pairs to train CNN models.

[Effective Presentation Attack Detection Driven by Face Related Task](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-20065-6_24)

Zhang, W.\*, **Liu, H.**\*, Liu, F., Ramachandra, R., & Busch, C. (**\* Equal Contribution**)
  
- Unlike this specific PAD task, other face related tasks trained by huge amount of real faces (e.g. face recognition and attribute editing) can be effectively adopted into different application scenarios. Inspired by this, we propose to trade position of PAD and face related work in a face system and apply the free acquired prior knowledge from face related tasks to solve face PAD, so as to improve the generalization ability in detecting PAs.

[Point Beyond Class: A Benchmark for Weakly Semi-Supervised Abnormality Localization in Chest X-Rays](https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-3-031-16437-8_24)

Ji, H.\*, **Liu, H.**\*, Li, Y.\*, Xie J., He, N., Huang, Y., Dong, W., Chen, X., Shen L. & Zheng, Y. (**\* Equal Contribution**)
 
- We propose to train the CXR abnormality localization framework via a weakly semi-supervised strategy, termed Point Beyond Class (PBC), which utilizes a small number of fully annotated CXRs with lesion-level bounding boxes and extensive weakly annotated samples by points. Such a point annotation setting can provide weakly instance-level information for abnormality localization with a marginal annotation cost.

[Group-wise Inhibition based Feature Regularization for Robust Classification](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content/ICCV2021/html/Liu_Group-Wise_Inhibition_Based_Feature_Regularization_for_Robust_Classification_ICCV_2021_paper.html)

**Liu, H.**, Wu, H., Xie, W., Liu, F., & Shen, L.

- CNN pays more attention to the most discriminative regions, but ignores the auxiliary features when learning, leading to the lack of feature diversity for final judgment. In our method, we propose to dynamically suppress significant activation values of CNN by group-wise inhibition, but not fixedly or randomly handle them when training. The feature maps with different activation distribution are then processed separately to take the feature independence into account. CNN is finally guided to learn richer discriminative features hierarchically for robust classification according to the proposed regularization. [**Code**](https://github.com/LinusWu/TENET_Training)
